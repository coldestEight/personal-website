My job was to create a web-scraping tool to collect data on the prices of grocery items in both the US and Canada. This was an extension of an older research project where the prices of 29 different products from 16 stores across various locations in the US and Canada over the course of a year (2022 - 2023). This was time consuming and required several people to manually note down prices every week and weekly maintenance of the research spreadsheet. The goal of developing the web-scraping tool was to simplify and speed up data collection as well as automatically maintaining/updating the spreadsheet. The areas of computer science my role related to was data collection and analysis."

The bulk of my work was in web-scraping, which I hadnâ€™t done before through coursework or on my own, so I had to learn while on the job. As such, I often had to do extensive research on new tools and libraries and determine which ones suited my needs the most. I also had to budget my time correctly to ensure that I was on-track to complete the project by the end of my 12-week term, as I was a one-man team. Overall the end-product is able to crawl through around 300 pages at 10 different store locations, in both the US and Canada, within minutes. Then that data can almost instantly be added to the existing data to create graphs, revealing trends and simplifying comparison. This takes a task that used to require several people in different locations to perform manually over the course of a week, to now being as simple as running a script on a single computer."

I learned more about how excel can be used to manage and organize data.
